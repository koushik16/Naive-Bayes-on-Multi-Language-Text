# Naive Bayes for Multilingual Text Classification

## Overview

This project implements the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification across multiple languages. The aim is to explore how Naive Bayes, a probabilistic machine learning algorithm, can be applied effectively to multilingual text data in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Features

- **Naive Bayes Implementation:** Custom implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification.
- **Multilingual Support:** Handles text data from multiple languages.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Dataset Support:** Supports various datasets for multilingual text classification.

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset:**
   - Ensure that your dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV or JSON) and contains labeled text data from multiple languages.
   
2. **Train the model:**
   - Run the training script to train the Naive Bayes classifier on your dataset.
     ```bash
     python train.py --dataset path_to_your_dataset
     ```

3. **Evaluate the model:**
   - Evaluate the trained model on a test set and view the results.
     ```bash
     python evaluate.py --dataset path_to_your_test_dataset
     ```

## Datasets

Some example datasets you can use:

- **Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Dataset**
- **Language Identification Dataset**
- **Spam/Ham Classification Dataset (in multiple languages)**
